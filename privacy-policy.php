							<p>We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:</p><ul><li>Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home</li><li>Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system</li><li>Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps</li></ul><p>You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results.

							<p class="vxK8q">We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services</p>
							<p>We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which <a class="g1mG8c" href="privacy?hl=en#footnote-useful-ads" data-name="useful-ads" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">ads you’ll find most useful</a>, <a class="g1mG8c" href="privacy?hl=en#footnote-people-online" data-name="people-online" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">the people who matter most to you online</a>, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.</p>
							<p>When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with <a class="g1mG8c" href="privacy?hl=en#footnote-unique-id" data-name="unique-id" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">unique identifiers</a> tied to the browser, application, or <a class="g1mG8c" href="privacy?hl=en#footnote-device" data-name="device" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">device</a> you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.</p>
							<p>When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as <a class="g1mG8c" href="privacy?hl=en#footnote-personal-info" data-name="personal-info" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">personal information</a>.</p>

							<p>When you create a Google Account, you provide us with <a class="g1mG8c" href="privacy?hl=en#footnote-personal-info" data-name="personal-info" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">personal information</a> that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a <a class="g1mG8c" href="privacy?hl=en#footnote-phone-number" data-name="phone-number" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">phone number</a> or <a class="g1mG8c" href="privacy?hl=en#footnote-payment-info" data-name="payment-info" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">payment information</a> to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.</p>
							<p>We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.  This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.</p>

This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.</p><hr><p>We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us <a class="g1mG8c" href="privacy?hl=en#footnote-detect-abuse" data-name="detect-abuse" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">detect abuse</a> such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use <a class="g1mG8c" href="privacy?hl=en#footnote-algorithm" data-name="algorithm" jsaction="click:IPbaae(preventDefault=true)">algorithms</a> to recognize patterns in data.

This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.</p><p>We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.</p></div></div>

							<h3>ads you’ll find most useful</h3><p>For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_whyad&amp;hl=en">about Google ads</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_whyad&amp;hl=en">why you may see particular ads</a>.</p><div id="footnote-people-online" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>the people who matter most to you online</h3><p>For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you <a href="https://contacts.google.com?hl=en">contact most frequently</a>.</p><div id="footnote-phone-number" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>phone number</h3><p>If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_phone&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more</a></p><div id="footnote-payment-info" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>payment information</h3><p>For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.</p><p>We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_agereq&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more</a></p><div id="footnote-devices" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>devices</h3><p>For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.</p><div id="footnote-android-device" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>Android device with Google apps</h3><p>Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.</p><div id="footnote-content-views" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>Views and interactions with content and ads</h3><p>For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.</p><div id="footnote-chrome-sync" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>synced with your Google Account</h3><p>Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome?p=privpol_chrsync&amp;hl=en">Learn more</a></p><div id="footnote-calls-messages" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages</h3><p>Examples of these services include:</p><ul><li>Google Hangouts, for making domestic and international calls</li><li>Google Voice, for making calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail</li><li>Google Fi, for a phone plan</li></ul><div id="footnote-sensor-data" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>Sensor data from your device</h3><p>Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement.

If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_androidloc&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more</a></p><div id="footnote-sources" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>publicly accessible sources</h3><p>For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s language models and build features like Google Translate.</p><div id="footnote-against-abuse" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>protect against abuse</h3><p>For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).</p><div id="footnote-ad-services" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>advertising and research services on their behalf</h3><p>For example, advertisers may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can better understand the performance of their ad campaigns.

And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.</p><div id="footnote-make-improvements" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>make improvements</h3><p>For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.</p><div id="footnote-customized-search" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>customized search results</h3><p>For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web &amp; App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch?p=privpol_searchactivity&amp;hl=en">learn more here</a>. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch?p=privpol_incognito&amp;hl=en">search and browse privately</a> or turn off <a href="https://www.google.com/history/optout?hl=en">signed-out search personalization</a>.</p><div id="footnote-personalized-ads" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>personalized ads</h3><p>You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_whyad&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more</a></p><div id="footnote-sensitive-categories" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>sensitive categories</h3><p>When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we <a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy?p=privpol_p13nad&amp;hl=en">require the same from advertisers</a> that use our services.</p><div id="footnote-link-info" class="ahbJ5">

Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics?p=privpol_data&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more</a></p><div id="footnote-safety-reliability" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>safety and reliability</h3><p>Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:</p><ul><li>Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.</li><li>The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. <a href="https://support.google.com/mail?p=privpol_signinactivity&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more</a></li></ul><div id="footnote-detect-abuse" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>detect abuse</h3><p>When we detect spam, malware, illegal content, and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.</p><div id="footnote-combine-info" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>combine the information we collect</h3><p>Some examples of how we combine the information we collect include:</p><ul><li>When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos. <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch?p=privpol_privresults&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more</a></li><li>If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name.

Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en">account settings</a> and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.</p><p><a href="technologies/partner-sites?hl=en">Learn more</a> about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.</p><div id="footnote-partner" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>partner with Google</h3><p>There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_controlads&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more</a></p><div id="footnote-delete-specific" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>specific Google services</h3><p>For example, you can delete <a href="https://support.google.com/blogger?p=privpol_blog&amp;hl=en">your blog</a> from Blogger or <a href="https://support.google.com/sites?p=privpol_delete&amp;hl=en">a Google Site you own</a> from Google Sites.

Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process.

It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.</p><div id="footnote-browser-storage" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>Browser web storage</h3><p>Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.</p>
							<div id="footnote-cookies-and-similar-technologies" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>Cookies and similar technologies</h3><p>A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies.

For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.</p><div id="footnote-info" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>Non-personally identifiable information</h3><p>This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.</p><div id="footnote-ip" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>IP address</h3><p>Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet.</p><div id="footnote-pixel" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>Pixel tag</h3><p>A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.</p><div id="footnote-personal-info" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>Personal information</h3><p>This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.</p>
							<div id="footnote-sensitive-info" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>Sensitive personal information</h3><p>This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.</p><div id="footnote-server-logs" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>Server logs</h3><p>Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</p><p>A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:</p><pre>123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -<br>http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -<br>Firefox 1.0.7; Windows NT 5.1 -<br>740674ce2123e969</pre><ul><li><code>123.45.67.89</code> is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.</li><li><code>25/Mar/2003 10:15:32</code> is the date and time of the query.</li><li><code>http://www.google.com/search?q=cars</code> is the requested URL, including the search query.</li><li><code>Firefox 1.0.7; Windows NT 5.1</code> is the browser and operating system being used.</li><li><code>740674ce2123a969</code> is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).</li></ul><div id="footnote-unique-id" class="ahbJ5"></div><h3>Unique identifiers</h3><p>A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.</p><p>Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about <a href="technologies/cookies?hl=en">how Google uses cookies</a>.</p><p>On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be <a href="technologies/ads?hl=en">managed</a> in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.</p></div>
